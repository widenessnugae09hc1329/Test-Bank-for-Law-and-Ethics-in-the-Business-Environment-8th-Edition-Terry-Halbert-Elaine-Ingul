Rather than shying away from controversial topics, it encourages lively classroom debate on everything from privacy and workers' rights to diversity and stereotyping. Insightful cases, end-of-chapter questions, historical quotes, and chapter projects sharpen critical thinking skills, while a wealth of interactive assignments like role plays, mock trials, roundtables, and more prepare you for the ethical and legal dilemmas of the business world.
